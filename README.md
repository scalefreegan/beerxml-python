## Description

The beerxml python package is a powerful tool designed to streamline the process of working with BeerXML files, ensuring that specific beer recipes adhere to the BeerXML standard. BeerXML is a widely adopted XML-based standard for representing brewing recipes, allowing brewers to share and exchange their recipes seamlessly.

## Installation

To install your package, use the following command:

```bash
pip install beerxml
```

## Usage

Import the `BeerxmlParser` class and inject the file content into the class like in the following example:

```python
from beerxml import BeerxmlParser

# Example usage
parser: BeerxmlParser = BeerxmlParser()
with open("path/to/xml.file", "r") as file_content:
    recipe = parser.parse(file_content.read())

print(recipe.name)
print(recipe.hops)
print(recipe.fermentables)
print(recipe.yeasts)
```
